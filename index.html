            <img class="aside-img" src="images/ginsburg.jpg" alt="Ruth Ginsburg">  
            <p>Ginsburg became only the second woman ever to serve as a justice on the nation's highest court.         
            </p>
            <p>She struggled against blatant sexism throughout her career as she climbed to the pinnacle of her profession.         
            </p>
            <p>A lifelong advocate of gender equality, she was fond of joking that there would be enough women on the nine-seat Supreme Court "when there are nine".    
            </p>
            <p>She did not let up in her twilight years, remaining a scathing dissenter on a conservative-tilting bench, even while her periodic health scares left liberal America on edge.          
            </p>
            <p>Despite maintaining a modest public profile, like most top judges, Ginsburg inadvertently became not just a celebrity, but a pop-culture heroine.      
            </p>
            <p>She may have stood an impish 5ft, but Ginsburg will be remembered as a legal colossus.

            <h2>Donald Trump on abortion: From pro-choice to pro-prison.</h2>
            <p>President Trump has already shown his anti-woman agenda in his actions. On the campaign trail, he also voiced support for a number of anti-choice policies that would have a devastating impact on women nationwide.      
            </p>
            <p>Donald Trump has made his opposition to reproductive freedom clear. He wants to completely ban abortion, with exceptions only for rape, incest, or when the life of the woman is in danger. He’s backed this up by showing support for a ban on abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy.  
            </p>
            <p>He said there should be “some sort of punishment” for women who seek abortion if it were outlawed. In fact, his decitions  agree with his words, Trump’s has chosen many nominees to the who are against reproductive freedom, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch.

                    <p>In a 5-4 decision, The Supreme Court rules that Title IX, which prohibits discrimination based on sex, also inherently prohibits disciplining someone for complaining about sex-based discrimination. It further holds that this is the case even when the person complaining is not among those being discriminated against.

                    <h3>The Meaning Behind the Lady of Justice Statue </h3>
                    <p>Anywhere on five continents, you are likely to see the Lady of Justice statue in courthouses, law offices, and legal educational institutions. The concept of Lady Justice is very ancient and dates back to the times of the ancient Greeks (goddess Themis) and Egyptians (goddess Ma’at).
